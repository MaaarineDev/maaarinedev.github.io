        <p>Firstly, I started making this project before even knowing that Gravity Falls had anything to do with ciphers.</p>
        <p>Of course, I knew you enjoyed Gravity Falls and wanted to use some ideas from shows familiar to you,</p>
        <p>but this was a perfect coincidence to discover about 2 days into the project.</p>
    </div>

        <p>I hope this wasn't too easy or too hard. I'd bet it leans more towards too easy. </p>
        <p>So, a short message:</p>
        <p>I've really appreciated being friends with you for some time now, especially in the past two school years.</p>
        <p>Having anchor with you is something I can consistently look forward to on the same time on the same days,</p>
        <p>brining a good kind of consistency to the week that's helped me out a lot.</p>
        <p>So... thanks!</p>
        <p>Oh, there is a small cash prize for this also. So just mention it at some point and I'll get that to you.</p>
        <p>Also, happy birthday. But that's been said before.</p>
